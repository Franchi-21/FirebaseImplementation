# Firebase implementation project

This project is intended to represent a simple login and register with Room for deleting, inserting, editing and showing users by giving their names and ages

Tools I used to make this project:
- Firebase, precisely Authentication
- Room
- MVVM and Clean Architecture
- Hilt to inject dependencies
- Coroutines and Flow
